ufs: A leaner, cleaner version of the userfriendlyscience package

The pkgdown website for this project is located at
<https://r-packages.gitlab.io/ufs>.

## Installation

You can install the released version of `ufs` from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages('ufs');
```

You can install the development version of `ufs` from
[GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/ufs');
```

If you want the even more cutting edge version, you can install from the
`dev` branch (as opposed to the default branch, `prod`) with:

``` r
remotes::install_gitlab('r-packages/ufs@dev');
```

(This is assuming you have the `remotes` packages installed; otherwise,
install that first using the `install.packages` function.)
