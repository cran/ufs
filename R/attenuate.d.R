#' Attenuate a Cohen's d estimate for unreliability in the continuous variable
#'
#' Measurement error (i.e. the complement of reliability) results in a downward bias
#' of observed effect sizes. This attenuation can be emulated by this function.
#'
#' @param d The value of Cohen's d (that would be obtained with perfect measurements)
#' @param reliability The reliability of the measurements of the continuous variable
#'
#' @return The attenuated value of Cohen's d
