#' Disattenuate a Cohen's d estimate for unreliability in the continuous variable
#'
#' Measurement error (i.e. the complement of reliability) results in a downward bias
#' of observed effect sizes. This attenuation can be reversed by disattenuation.
#'
#' @param d The (attenuated) value of Cohen's d (i.e. the value as observed in the sample,
#' and therefore attenuated (decreased) by measurement error in the continuous variable).
#' @param reliability The reliability of the measurements of the continuous variable
#'
#' @return The disattenuated value of Cohen's d
