\title{Disattenuate a Cohen's d estimate for unreliability in the continuous variable}
\usage{
disattenuate.d(d, reliability)
}
\arguments{
\item{d}{The (attenuated) value of Cohen's d (i.e. the value as observed in the sample,
and therefore attenuated (decreased) by measurement error in the continuous variable).}

\item{reliability}{The reliability of the measurements of the continuous variable}
}
\value{
The disattenuated value of Cohen's d
}
\description{
Measurement error (i.e. the complement of reliability) results in a downward bias
of observed effect sizes. This attenuation can be reversed by disattenuation.

\examples{
